# P1: Predicting Bike Share Users

> In this project, a neural network is built and trained from scratch to predict the number of bike share users on a given day.

## About
A neural network is built to predict the number of bike sharing rides. Considering data from a bike-sharing company (like [CycleHop](http://cyclehop.com/)), a neural network is developed to predict from historical data, the number of bikes needed in the future.
